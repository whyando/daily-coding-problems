Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Jane Street.

cons(a, b) constructs a pair, and car(pair) and cdr(pair) returns the first and last element of that pair. For example, car(cons(3, 4)) returns 3, and cdr(cons(3, 4)) returns 4.

Given this implementation of cons:

def cons(a, b):
    def pair(f):
        return f(a, b)
    return pair


Implement car and cdr.

MY ANSWER:
cons returns an object representing the pair which is a kind of curried function, the parameter of this function is another function of our choosing
so to get the first value, we pass a function on a pair returning the first value, here I used an anonymous function
