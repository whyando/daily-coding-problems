Daily Coding Problem: Problem #2 [Hard]

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Uber.

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?

MY ANSWER:
for the follow-up, lets compute, for each i,
X[i] = product of array elements with index < i
Y[i] = product of array elements with index > i

then: output[i] = X[i]*Y[i] and done.

since we can calculate X and Y with a single pass each, this solution has O(N) time complexity
(we can also save on memory by removing arrays X,Y and putting the products straight into output if we choose)

edges cases: 
    0 as an input (division by 0) 
    integer overflow reached fast
    input array size 0 or 1
