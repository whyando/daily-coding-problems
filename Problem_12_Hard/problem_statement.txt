There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of
unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.

For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:

1, 1, 1, 1
2, 1, 1
1, 2, 1
1, 1, 2
2, 2
What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb any number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5
steps at a time.


MY ANSWER:
let F(N) be the number of ways to climb the staircase of N steps,
then F(N) = F(N-1) + F(N-2)
F(0) = 1
F(1) = 1

cool we have the fibinacci numbers which we can compute easily


if we are given a set X of step lengths, we simply adjust the recursion to hit the values in X 
ie F(N) = F(N-1) + F(N-3) + F(N-5)
