Daily Coding Problem: Problem #14 [Medium]

The area of a circle is defined as πr^2. Estimate π to 3 decimal places using a Monte Carlo method.

Hint: The basic equation of a circle is x2 + y2 = r2.

MY ANSWER:
consider a square of side length 2, with an inscribed circle of radius 1

if we pick a point randomly inside the square, the probablity it also lies inside the circle is PI/4
since PI and 4 are the respective areas of the circle and square

so we repeatedly pick points in the square and let the fraction that also lie inside the circle be our estimate for PI/4


since the question asks for 3dp specifically, we might ask how many points must we pick to get this accuracy
to answer this we would turn to ideas of binomial distributions and confidence intervals maybe with some normal distribution approximations thrown in
