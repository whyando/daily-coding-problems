Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1 [Easy]

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was recently asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?


MY ANSWER:
O(N^2) solution:
iterate each pair of indices and compute their sum

O(N ln N) solution:
sort the list and then double iterator, one from the front the other from the back

O(N) solution:
do a counting sort type technique, when we read x in the list,
    set hit[x] = true
    and check hit[K - x]

depending on the domain, could be done using a
 - std::unordered_set (hashmap)
 - std::set (red-black tree) [O(NlogN)]
 - std::vector or array
