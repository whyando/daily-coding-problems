Daily Coding Problem: Problem #10 [Medium]

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Apple.

Implement a job scheduler which takes in a function f and an integer n, and calls f after n milliseconds.

MY ANSWER:
this one is a bit bizarre imo, since this is exactly what setTimeout(f, n) does in javascript

for a moment I'll imagine I'm trying to get similar behaviour in C++,

then maybe when the schedule(f, n) call is made I would
 - first calculate t, the time when the function is to be called
 - store the pair (f,t) in some kind of datastructure like a priority queue so I can easily pull the next function to be called

at a later point, when control is ceeded back to the scheduler, we can sleep until the next function is due to be called (or call it immediately if we are late)
