Daily Coding Problem: Problem #13 [Hard]

Given an integer k and a string s, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.

For example, given s = "abcba" and k = 2, the longest substring with k distinct characters is "bcb".

MY ANSWER:
lets do a dual iterator strategy where we work with some interval,

if the interval contains at most k distinct characters, we make the interval longer by increasing the right iterator
otherwise, we make the interval shorter by increasing the left iterator,


we keep track of the longest (meeting the criteria) interval we have seen
also importantly: we keep track of the exact number of each character inside our interval, therefore we know if we have at most k distinct characters or not


I claim that the longest substring with k distinct characters will be looked at by our algorithm

proof: suppose that one such longest substring S is on indexes [a, b]

then at some point, the left iterator will become a, then the left iterator will not increase until the right iterator is b+1

what if the right iterator was already b+1 or greater?:
    then we have previously seen a substring meeting the criteria longer than S
